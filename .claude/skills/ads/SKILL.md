## Integration with Marketing OS Workflow

**Input from:**
- `/marketing-campaign` - Campaign structure, KPIs, and benchmarks to compare against
- `/content-creation` - Creative quality reference for ad audit

**Output for:**
- Optimization recommendations (loop back to campaign planning or content creation)
- Performance insights that inform future briefs

**When to Use:**
- After campaigns have been running for 1-2 weeks
- When performance is below expectations
- As part of ongoing optimization (weekly/bi-weekly)
- Before scaling budget

**Note:** This skill can be used independently - you don't need to go through the full workflow to audit ads. Just provide campaign data and metrics.
