## Trend-Jacking Strategy

### How to Find Trends
1. **Discover page** - See what's trending
2. **Creative Center** - tiktok.com/creative-center
3. **Sounds** - Look for "trending" arrow on sounds
4. **Competitors** - What are similar accounts doing?

### Trend-Jacking Formula
```
[Trending format/sound] + [Your brand twist] = Fresh content
```

### Timing

- **Too early:** Trend might not catch on
- **Too late:** Trend is oversaturated

2. **Watch time:** How long did they watch?
3. **Rewatch:** Did they watch again?
4. **Engagement:** Likes, comments, shares, saves
5. **If metrics good:** Show to larger audience

### What Boosts Reach
