## LinkedIn-Specific Tips

### Formatting
- **Use line breaks** every 1-2 sentences
- **Bullet points** for lists (use • or emojis)
- **Bold text** with asterisks for emphasis
- **Keep paragraphs short** (2-3 lines max)

### First Line Strategy
The first line is everything - it appears in the feed preview:

**Good hooks:**
- "Unpopular opinion: [statement]"
- "Here's what nobody tells you about [topic]..."
- "In my X years in [industry], I've learned..."
- "Stop [common action]. Here's why..."
- "The most expensive lesson I learned..."

**Bad hooks:**
- "I'm excited to announce..."
- "Here is my latest post about..."
- "Some thoughts on..."

### Engagement Bait
LinkedIn encourages meaningful engagement:

**Good engagement questions:**
- "What's your experience with this?"
- "Would you add anything to this list?"
- "I'm curious - how do you handle [situation]?"
- "What would you do differently?"

**Avoid:**
- "Like if you agree"
- "Comment 'yes' for..."
- Generic engagement bait

## Hashtag Strategy

### LinkedIn Hashtag Best Practices
- **Quantity:** 3-5 hashtags maximum
- **Relevance:** Must be highly relevant to content
- **Mix:** 1-2 broad, 2-3 niche
- **Placement:** At the very bottom

### Good LinkedIn Hashtags
- #Marketing (broad)
- #ContentMarketing (niche)
- #B2BMarketing (specific)
- #IndonesiaBusiness (location)
- #YourBrand (branded)

### Avoid
- More than 5 hashtags (looks spammy)
- Irrelevant hashtags
- Only super broad hashtags
- Hashtags in the middle of content

## Professional Tone Guide

### Appropriate for LinkedIn
- Professional insights
- Industry trends
- Career advice
- Business lessons
- Leadership thoughts
- Data-backed opinions
- Meaningful discussions

### Not Ideal for LinkedIn
- Purely personal content (save for Instagram)
- Controversial for controversy's sake
- Overly promotional content
- Generic motivational quotes
- Political content (unless relevant to your field)

### Voice Examples

**Thought Leader:**
"In my 15 years leading teams, I've noticed one pattern..."

**Helpful Expert:**
"Here's a framework that's helped me and my clients..."

**Relatable Professional:**
"We've all been there - the meeting that could've been an email..."

**Data-Driven:**
"After analyzing 500+ campaigns, here's what surprised me..."
