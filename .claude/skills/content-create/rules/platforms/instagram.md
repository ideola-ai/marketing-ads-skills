## Instagram Algorithm Notes

### Feed Ranking Signals
- **Relationship:** Do they engage with you?
- **Interest:** Have they engaged with similar content?
- **Timeliness:** How recent is the post?
- **Frequency:** How often do they open Instagram?
- **Following:** How many accounts do they follow?
- **Usage:** How long do they spend on Instagram?

### What Boosts Reach
- Saves (strongest signal)
- Shares
- Comments (meaningful, not generic)
- Profile visits from your post
- Time spent viewing

### What Hurts Reach
- Low engagement on your post
- Users scrolling past quickly
- Shadowban risk: Using banned hashtags

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wall of text** - Break up with line breaks and emojis
2. **Weak hooks** - First line must grab attention
3. **Inconsistent posting** - Algorithm favors consistency
4. **Ignoring Stories** - Stories build relationships
5. **Buying followers** - Kills engagement rate
6. **Wrong hashtags** - Use relevant, properly sized tags
7. **Not engaging** - Reply to comments, engage in your niche
